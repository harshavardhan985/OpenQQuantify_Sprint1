Overview
This script demonstrates how to interact with the OpenAI API using a specific model hosted on the NVIDIA integration platform. The script reads the content from a text file and sends it to the Mistral AI model, requesting code implementations based on the content.

Prerequisites
Python 3.6+: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
OpenAI Python Library: Install the OpenAI library to interact with the API.
Setup
Clone the Repository (if applicable):

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Install the Required Packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install openai
Set Up API Key and Base URL:

Replace the placeholder api_key with your actual OpenAI API key.
Ensure the base_url is correctly set to "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1".
Configuration
API Key and Base URL:

Open the script file and locate the following lines:
python
Copy code
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="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",
    base_url="https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1"
)
Replace the api_key with your actual API key from OpenAI.
File Path:

Specify the path to your text file in the file_path variable:
python
Copy code
file_path = r'C:\Users\allah\OneDrive\Documents\A_Data\NJM2113M.txt'
Usage
Run the Script:

Execute the script by running the following command in your terminal:
bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Ensure the script name is correctly specified.
Functionality:

The script reads the entire content of the specified text file.
It sends the content to the Mistral AI model using the OpenAI API.
The model generates code implementations based on the provided content.
The response from the model is streamed and printed to the console.
Functions
read_file_content(file_path)
Reads the entire content of a file and returns it as a string.

Parameters:

file_path (str): The path to the file to be read.
Returns:

str: The content of the file.
send_to_mistral(text_content)
Sends the given text content to the Mistral AI model and prints the response.

Parameters:
text_content (str): The text content to be sent to the AI model.
Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling to catch and print any exceptions that occur during the API call.
Notes
Ensure your text file is in a readable format and the path is correctly specified.
The script uses streaming to handle the response from the model efficiently.
